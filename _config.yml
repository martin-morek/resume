  Hi. I'm Martin, a software developer in love with functional programming. I am a reliable and skilled software developer with more than five years of professional programming experience, last three years primarily focusing on Scala and Java language, developing microservice architecture and distributed applications. During my prior career I worked with different technologies on various positions through several companies, which offered me opportunity to collect a lot of experience. Last two years Iâ€™ve been working as an independent remote contractor so I have a plenty experience with remote work and independent work.
