    I started as a member of a team which was primarily focused on Ruby on Rails projects. Our main project was a customer loyalty system fully developed in RoR. My position was a full stack developer and I was responsible for implementing new features based on customer requirements, creating unit tests and fixing bugs.

    Later, I moved from Ruby projects to Java (Spring Boot) and Scala (Akka) projects. These projects were designed and built from scratch by our team.
