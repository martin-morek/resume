    As a remote freelance developer I've worked for several companies from different parts of the world.
    Working as a remote freelancer is challenging but besides improving my programming knowleage
    it offers me an opportunity to improve my soft skills, such as remote communication, cooperation with a client,
    responsibility for a deadline and time management.

    I was a part of a small, autonomous, agile backend team, closely working with frontend developers
    and product specialists. Except for implementing new features, part of my job was also
    doing DevOps (deploying new versions, configuring environments). Applicationâ€™s backend
    was composed of multiple microservices developed in Scala language (Play framework, Akka)
    or Java (Spring boot), everything running in Docker containers on AWS.

    I was a member of a team which was generally focused on Ruby on Rails projects.
    Our prime project was a customer loyalty system fully developed in RoR.
    I was a full-stack developer responsible for implementing new features based
    on customer requirements, creating unit tests and fixing bugs. Along with Ruby projects,
    I worked on Java (Spring Boot) and Scala (Akka) projects. This position
    gave me a brief introduction into Fintech industry.
