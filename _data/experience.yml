    I've been a participant on multiple projects as a remote freelancer focused on backend development, besides that also developing my personal project built with Scala and PlayFramework.

    Working as a remote freelancer gave me an opportunity to improve my soft skills, such as remote communication and cooperation with a client, responsibility for a deadline and time management. Moreover, it offered me the chance to learn new things and travel.

    I was part of a small, autonomous, agile team and I was working closely with Frontend developers and product specialists. Except for implementing new features, also part of my job was doing DevOps (deploying a new version, configuring environments). Applicationâ€™s backend was composed of multiple microservices developed in Scala language (Play framework, Akka) or Java (Spring boot), everything running in Docker containers on AWS.

    I was a member of a team which was primarily focused on Ruby on Rails projects. Our most important project was a customer loyalty system fully created in RoR. My position was a full stack developer and I was responsible for implementing new features based on customer requirements, creating unit tests and fixing bugs. Besides Ruby projects, I also worked on one Java (Spring Boot) and one Scala (Akka) project. These projects were built from scratch, designed by our team.

    I started as a junior developer collaborating on a custom customer relationship management system. The system backbone technologies were PHP and MySQL on the backend side, Javascript, HTML and CSS on the frontend. Later, I worked as a Java developer on several other projects built with Spring Boot framework. My responsibility was designing REST API for communication with front-end, implementing application backend core functionality and fixing bugs.
